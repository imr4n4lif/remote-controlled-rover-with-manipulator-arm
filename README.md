# Remote Controlled Rover with Manipulator Arm

## Description:
An Arduino-powered rover equipped with a robotic arm, designed for remote-controlled operation. The system includes a custom-built wireless remote that controls both the movement of the rover and the articulation of the robotic arm. The rover can move forward, backward, and turn in both directions, while the robotic arm can perform actions such as lifting and placing objects. The remote features separate controls for the wheels and the arm, allowing precise and simultaneous operation. This project showcases the integration of wireless communication, motor control, and robotic mechanisms using Arduino technology.
